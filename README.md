# DevelopersPrayer

Our Object, who art in memory, hallowed by thy bits.
Thy extensions come, thy will be done,
on Console as it is in memory.
Give us this day our passing test,
and forgive us our refractions,
as we forgive those who refactor against us.
And lead us not into exceptions, 
but deliver us from null points.
For thine is the super,
methods and properties forever and ever.
